        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="abouttext">
            Rogues Gallery is a dedicated team of game developers and designers that seek out and help publish and develop independent game studios.

            Rogues Gallery is a game developer/publisher that specializes in supporting small independent developers in advertising, financial support, and launching their games. We have a dedicated team that seeks out promising developers and help them to realize their ideas against the rising tide of triple A games. We prided ourselves on keeping game development open to all people and telling stories that would otherwise slip through the cracks. Helping independent companies keeps the games industry evolving and innovating.
